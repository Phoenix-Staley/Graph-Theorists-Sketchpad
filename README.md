# A Graph Theorist's Sketchpad

This is Phoenix Staley's work for the "Graph Theorist's Sketchpad" project for the Graph Theory class at Washington State University. It allows the user to create and remove nodes and edges, along with various other functionality.

It is currently still under development, but more sections with the various features and functionality of this application will be added as they are finalized.
